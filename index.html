            I was an average student in my initial time of school because I was constantly missing school due to many illness. I liked mathematics in my school days. Then I choose PCM in Class 11 <sup>th</sup> and started preparing for JEE. During my JEE days, I grew fond of Economics and Finance, thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EconomicsExplained" target =blank class="link">  Economics Explained</a> and Finance Channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/warikoo" target="blank" class="link"> Ankur Warikoo</a> &<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/rachanaphadke" target="blank" class="link"> Rachna Ranande</a>. I am still exploring these topics and getting better by each passing days. I believe Finance has a role to play in everyone's life and Financial independence is necessary than anyting in today's world.
            <br>
            <br>
    
            Let's come to JEE. I was only preparing 
            for JEE Mains, I scored well in January JEE Mains. I was very happy that I would get a seat in a Tier-1 NIT , but life had other plans. National Lockdown was announced in March, wasn't able to give my sixth and last subject board exam for which I was grateful. During lockdown, I studied like there is no tommorow and took my JEE Advance-2020.
            <br>
            <br>
            I got a good rank and enrolled in Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar. After coming here, I am doing many things which I would not have ever thought of doing in IIT and Life continues on.

                <h3>Finance and Economics</h3>
                I love to Study about Economics and specially Financial markets and their functioning. I usually spend 45 minutes each day reading Financial news. I am believer of free market to achieve maximum efficiency but not the likes of laissez faire Capitalism. I like to study macro-economics also to know what is happening in the world.

                <h3>Management</h3>
                I consider my-self to be quite managed person. I like to lead and manage a team towards a common goal for which we as a team are striving for. A team can easily make up for less talent by working together which requires a thoughtful leader. Managerial skills for of most important skills in any domain and I like to hone this skill a lot.

                <h3>Data Analytics</h3>
                I like playing with data. To make inference just from set of numbers is truly fascinating to me in many aspect. Statistics and Probability are one of my favourite disciplines. I have tried my hands on Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib,Scipy and many more.

                <h3>Politics</h3>
                I started to like politics from 11 <sup>th</sup> class, not because of people invovled in it but the impact it can have on public for the greater good of society. Every person is politcal in his own way. Ideology of a person defines who he really is but you should not be a slave to an ideology.

                <h3>Formula-1 Racing</h3>
                I started watching Formula-1 in 2011 due to Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull. Over time, I started to like F-1 cutting edge machinery possible only due to Engineering. F1 is a mixture of Engineering , Talent and Tactics which you would not find anywhere else. I have always supported Red-Bull and happy to see Max winning the championship.
