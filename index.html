        <h3 class="heading_life"> Story of my Life</h3>
        <p id="content">
            
            I have lived entirety of my life in Roorkee ,Uttarakhand. During my school days, I was a shy kid who was ill half the time and I was 
            not good at sports. I liked mathematics from my school days and still do. I choose PCM stream in Class 11 <sup>th</sup> and started preparing for JEE. During my JEE days, I grew fond of Economics and Finance, 
            thanks to youtube channels like Economics Explained and Finance Channels like Rachna Ranande. I am still exploring these topics and getting better by each passing day via learning & checking new stuff each day. 
            I believe Finance has a role to play in everyone's life and it is important to know about it in order to make better decisions in life.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's come back to JEE prepartion. I took local coaching only and did not wander to new cities for coaching. 
            From starting, I was only preparing for JEE Mains, I scored well in January JEE Mains. I was very happy that I would get a seat in a Tier-1 NIT , but life had other plans. 
            National Lockdown was announced in March, wasn't able to give my sixth and last subject board exam for which I was grateful. 
            During lockdown, There was nothing else beside studying and this helped me to improve my performance. 
            Life was tough during those days but those were the days which made me what I am today.
            <br>
            <br>
            I got a good rank in JEE-Advance and enrolled in IIT Ropar.After coming here, I have studied various topic, which I would not have ever thought in my childhood.
            Three Years have passed since I enter college and life is moving on. In one year, I will moving to next stage of my life and  
            hoping to get new expirience. Let's see what life holds for me.

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                I like to code & develop new applications in my free time. I usually mix it with my other interest to make meaning-full stuff which help in real-life. 
                I solve algorithmic questions also and do competative programming to improve my skills in data structures and help me sharped my mind.

                <h3>Finance and Economics</h3>
                I love to Study about Economics and specially Financial markets and their functioning. I am believer of free market to achieve maximum efficiency 
                but not the likes of laissez faire Capitalism. I have also started working towards quant career. I hope one day I will be able to work in this field.

                <h3>Management</h3>
                I like to lead and manage a team towards a common goal for which we as a team are striving for. A team can easily make up for less talent by 
                working together which requires a thoughtful leader. Managerial skills for of most important skills in any domain specially in software industry.

                <h3>Data Analytics</h3>
                I like playing with data. To make inference just from set of numbers is truly fascinating to me in many aspect. 
                Statistics and Probability are one of my favourite disciplines. I have tried my hands on Numpy, Pandas, Keras, Tensorflow and Matplotlib and many more.

                <h3>Politics</h3>
                I started to like politics in 11 <sup>th</sup> class, not because of people invovled in it but the impact it can have on 
                public for the greater good of society. Every person is politcal in his own way. Ideology of a person defines a person.

                <h3>Formula-1 Racing</h3>
                I started watching Formula-1 in 2011 due to Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull. Over time, I started to like F-1 because of cutting edge machinery. 
                F1 is a mixture of Engineering, Talent and Tactics which you would not find anywhere else.
