        <h3 class="heading_life"> Story of my Life</h3>
        <p id="content">
            
            I mainly lived my life in Roorkee ,Uttarakhand. I was an average student in my initial days of school because I was constantly missing school due to many illness. I liked mathematics from my school days and still like now. Then I choose PCM in Class 11 <sup>th</sup> and started preparing for JEE. During my JEE days, I grew fond of Economics and Finance, thanks to youtube channels like  Economics Explained and Finance Channels like Rachna Ranande. I am still exploring these topics and getting better by each passing day by learning new stuff each day. I believe Finance has a role to play in everyone's life.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's come to JEE. I was only preparing 
            for JEE Mains, I scored well in January JEE Mains. I was very happy that I would get a seat in a Tier-1 NIT , but life had other plans. National Lockdown was announced in March, wasn't able to give my sixth and last subject board exam for which I was grateful. During lockdown, I studied a lot to improve my performance. Life was tough those days but I enjoyed a lot which I miss a lot now.
            <br>
            <br>
            I got a good rank in JEE-Advance and enrolled in IIT Ropar. After coming here, I am doing many things which I would not have ever thought of doing in IIT and Life continues on.
            <br>
            <br>
            Two Years have passed since I enter college and life is going on. Let's see what life holds for me.

                I like to code in my free time. I usually mix it with my other interest to make meaning-full stuff for me which help in real-life. I solve algorithmic questions also and do competative programming to improve my skills in data structures.

                <h3>Management</h3>
                I like to lead and manage a team towards a common goal for which we as a team are striving for. A team can easily make up for less talent by working together which requires a thoughtful leader. Managerial skills for of most important skills in any domain.

                I like playing with data. To make inference just from set of numbers is truly fascinating to me in many aspect. Statistics and Probability are one of my favourite disciplines. I have tried my hands on Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib,Scipy and many more.

                <h3>Politics</h3>
                I started to like politics from 11 <sup>th</sup> class, not because of people invovled in it but the impact it can have on public for the greater good of society. Every person is politcal in his own way. Ideology of a person defines a person.

                <h3>Formula-1 Racing</h3>
                I started watching Formula-1 in 2011 due to Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull. Over time, I started to like F-1 cutting edge machinery possible. F1 is a mixture of Engineering , Talent and Tactics which you would not find anywhere else.
