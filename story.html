        I was an average student in my initial time of school because I was constantly missing school due to many illness. I liked mathematics in my school days. Then I choose PCM in Class 11 <sup>th</sup> and started preparing for JEE. During my JEE days, I grew fond of Economics and Finance, thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EconomicsExplained" target =blank class="link">  Economics Explained</a> and Finance Channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/warikoo" target="blank" class="link"> Ankur Warikoo</a> &<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/rachanaphadke" target="blank" class="link"> Rachna Ranande</a>. I am still exploring these topics and getting better by each passing days. I believe Finance has a role to play in everyone's life and Financial independence is necessary than anyting in today's world.

        Let's come to JEE. I was only preparing 
        for JEE Mains, I scored well in January JEE Mains.I was very happy that I would get in a Tier-1 NIT , but life had other plans. National Lockdown was announced in March, wasn't able to give my sixth and last subject board exam for which I was grateful. During lockdown, I studied like there is no tommorow and took my JEE Advance-2020.

        I got a good rank and enrolled in Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar , doing many things which I would not have ever thought of, after coming to IIT and Life continues on.
